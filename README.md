# Lunar Lander

The project utilizes the Stable Baselines3 library, which is a collection of state-of-the-art reinforcement learning algorithms, to train an A2C (Advantage Actor-Critic) model on the LunarLander-v2 environment from OpenAI Gym.

The A2C algorithm is a model-free, on-policy reinforcement learning algorithm that combines elements of both policy-based and value-based methods. It learns a policy and an estimate of the value function simultaneously, enabling it to make more informed decisions in an environment.
